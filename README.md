# OpenGL Modeling and Prediction Project
As someone who has experience working with the Unity Game Engine, I have always wanted to learn more about how the engine works. This led me to begin learning about OpenGL Specification for computer graphics.

Using the website learnopengl.com, I was able to learn the basics and more advanced features of opengl, from VBOs, VAOs, and EBOs, to stenciling, depth testing, and framebuffers.

My goal for this project is to continue to learn the more advanced features of OpenGL, and begin to use my machine learning skills in computer graphics applications such as vertex prediction and optimization.
